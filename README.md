Minimal Shooter
========================

About
-----
This is a minimalist game only consisting of circles. The player is the circle in the center of the screen. The player can shoot small circles in the direction of the mouse cursor by clicking the mouse. Every time the player shoots, the enemies grow larger. If the player hits the enemies they shrink. If the enemy hits the player, the player shrinks. If any of the circles(player or enemy) shrink to a small enough size, the circle dies. The enemies respawn after all of the enemies in the wave are killed. There are no points or lives. I just made this game to practice with Unity a bit more. I wanted to play around with the 2D physics engine.
